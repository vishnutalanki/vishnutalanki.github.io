### Ramble

I've always been deeply passionate about biology and chemistry and the future of how we work with organic matter, chemicals, etc.

I mean these are the building blocks of life, and now we can make sand think for us, and think about us.

Everything is 1's and 0's, living/non-living. 

All the chemical signals within our body can be represneted as a 1 or a 0. 

I'm eagerly looking forward to the day when the entire human genome is understood or a vaccine for cancer is created. Even better if I'm a part of it in a way that complements my skills.

We need to be asking bigger questions.

Digging deep down, it's not just "What If"; enhance that with "Why not?", "How about?"....and maybe more. It's difficult to put it into words.

I missed being a doctor by 20 ranks (F'ed up system in India), but who knows, maybe there's impact waiting to be unraveled someplace else.

Imagine having access to gene sequence of bacteria from the arctic tundra. Imagine working with people who know what can be done with that.

Imagine modelling data to create safer fertilizers, better industrial solvents, reducing pollution and improving sustainability.

Imagine.
