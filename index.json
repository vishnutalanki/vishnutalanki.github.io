[{"categories":null,"contents":"Fox Sports Senior Data Engineer, Sports Data Platform New York\nAbstract The Fox Sports Data Platform was built to process, enrich, and serve real-time/historical sports data for major leagues like the NFL, MLB, and NBA. The project involved building a scalable ETL pipeline capable of handling on average 1TB+ semi-structured data, exposing insights via low-latency APIs, and integrating AI-driven sports analytics to enhance fan engagement, next gen stats for sportscasters and overall data visibility.\nThis deep dive covers:\nThe vision behind the platform The business and technical value My specific role and leadership contributions Challenges faced \u0026amp; how they were overcome How this experience prepares me for engineering challenges at startups and large orgs alike 1Ô∏è‚É£ Vision Why was this project initiated?\nThe data products division @ Fox Sports ideated a real-time, scalable sports data pipeline for live broadcasts, analytics, and AI-powered insights (next-gen stats). The existing system was expensive, and difficult to scale both vertically and horizontally with increasing demand. We aimed to reduce framework redundancy i.e. make it sport agnostic, streamline ETL workflows, improve query speeds, and enable real-time AI integration. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Value: Business \u0026amp; Technical Impact üìà Business Value Faster Insights: Enabled low-latency lookups for enriched sports rankings, highly granular play-by-play data, player stats, and predictions (beta). ‚öôÔ∏è Technological Impact Transitioned to Medallion Architecture (Bronze ‚Üí Silver ‚Üí Gold) for efficient data processing. Delta Lake adoption enabled versioning, ACID transactions, and optimized query performance. Integrated Generative AI (LLaMA3.1, Amazon Bedrock, Amzaon Polly) for event summarization (in-point) and AI commentary. Data Governance and visibility was acheived through automated data dicitionary scripts as well as Unity Catalog for detailed lineage trackig Databricks jobs was utilized for orchestration and MLflow for expirement tracking, model promotion and registry, etc. 3Ô∏è‚É£ My Role üîπ Architecture \u0026amp; Tech Stack Built ETL Pipelines using PySpark, Spark SQL, and Pydantic for structured data ingestion Designed \u0026amp; Optimized Data Lakehouse using AWS S3, Databricks, and Delta Lake Developed GraphQL APIs for real-time query access View on Eraser\nWhy Medallion/Delta Lake Why did we choose Medallion or Delta Lake based Lakehouse arch in this context\nPros Cons üîπ Leadership \u0026amp; Ownership Led a team of 4 offshore engineers, managing and delegating tasks via Jira and following a Kanban framework to keep track of tasks and bugs. Collaborated with multiple stakeholders across the spectrum - Software Engineers, Data Scientists, TPM\u0026rsquo;s, etc. Mentored junior developers and performed code reviews, pair porogramming, etc, for enhanced colloab between engineers. 4Ô∏è‚É£ Challenges üîπ Technical Challenges High-latency queries on 1TB+ datasets ‚Üí Solved using Delta Lake partitioning and ElastiCache. Vendor APIs had inconsistent formats ‚Üí Standardized using Pydantic data models. GraphQL APIs struggling under heavy traffic ‚Üí Implemented query caching \u0026amp; pagination. üîπ Business \u0026amp; Leadership Challenges Aligning cross-functional teams (engineering, analytics, ML) ‚Üí Led biweekly syncs \u0026amp; detailed documentation. Onboarding offshore engineers unfamiliar with sports analytics ‚Üí Created a knowledge-sharing framework. 5Ô∏è‚É£ Conclusion \u0026amp; Key Takeaways Handling Complex Scientific Data: Just as sports data is semi-structured and real-time, so is biomedical and cheminformatics data. Building Scalable Data Platforms: Expertise in Databricks, AWS, and Snowflake applies directly to Montai‚Äôs infrastructure needs. AI/ML Integration: Experience with LLMs and real-time analytics will help enhance scientific data processing. Built a scalable real-time sports data pipeline for Fox Sports. Optimized data processing, reduced costs, and improved API performance. Led cross-functional collaboration across engineering, ML, and product teams. Directly applicable skills for Montai: scalable ETL, cloud infrastructure, AI-driven data processing. üì© Contact me on LinkedIn\n","date":"February 16, 2025","hero":"/images/default-hero.jpg","permalink":"https://vishnutalanki.github.io/posts/fox_sports/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"fox-sports\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFox Sports\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSenior Data Engineer, Sports Data Platform\nNew York\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"abstract\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbstract\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Fox Sports Data Platform was built to process, enrich, and serve real-time/historical sports data for major leagues like the \u003cstrong\u003eNFL, MLB, and NBA\u003c/strong\u003e.
