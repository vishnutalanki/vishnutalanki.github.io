[{"categories":null,"contents":"Fox Sports: Deep Dive (Senior Data Engineer, Sports Data Platform) Abstract The Fox Sports Data Platform was built to process, enrich, and serve real-time sports data for major leagues like the NFL, MLB, and NBA. The project involved building a scalable ETL pipeline capable of handling 1TB+ semi-structured data, exposing insights via low-latency GraphQL APIs, and integrating AI-driven sports analytics to enhance fan engagement.\nThis deep dive covers:\nThe vision behind the platform The business and technical value My specific role and leadership contributions Challenges faced \u0026amp; how they were overcome How this experience prepares me for challenges at Montai Therapeutics 1Ô∏è‚É£ Vision Why was this project initiated?\nFox Sports wanted a real-time, scalable sports data pipeline for live broadcasts, analytics, and AI-powered insights. The existing system was slow, expensive, and difficult to scale with increasing demand. We aimed to streamline ETL workflows, improve query speeds, and enable real-time AI integration. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Value: Business \u0026amp; Technical Impact üìà Business Value Faster Insights: Enabled real-time sports rankings, player stats, and predictions. API Optimization: GraphQL APIs handling 10,000+ requests/day improved response times by 50%. Cost Efficiency: Databricks optimizations reduced processing costs by 20%. ‚öôÔ∏è Technological Impact Transitioned to Medallion Architecture (Bronze ‚Üí Silver ‚Üí Gold) for efficient data processing. Delta Lake adoption enabled versioning, ACID transactions, and optimized query performance. Integrated Generative AI (LLaMA2, Amazon Bedrock) for automated analysis. 3Ô∏è‚É£ My Role üîπ Architecture \u0026amp; Tech Stack Built ETL Pipelines using PySpark, Spark SQL, and Pydantic for structured data ingestion. Designed \u0026amp; Optimized Data Lakehouse using AWS S3, Databricks, and Delta Lake. Developed GraphQL APIs for real-time query access. üîπ Leadership \u0026amp; Ownership Led a team of 4 offshore engineers, managing tasks via Kanban \u0026amp; Jira. Collaborated with ML teams to implement metadata management for real-time predictions. Worked cross-functionally with product managers and analysts to align data requirements. 4Ô∏è‚É£ Challenges \u0026amp; Solutions üîπ Technical Challenges High-latency queries on 1TB+ datasets ‚Üí Solved using Delta Lake partitioning and ElastiCache. Vendor APIs had inconsistent formats ‚Üí Standardized using Pydantic data models. GraphQL APIs struggling under heavy traffic ‚Üí Implemented query caching \u0026amp; pagination. üîπ Business \u0026amp; Leadership Challenges Aligning cross-functional teams (engineering, analytics, ML) ‚Üí Led biweekly syncs \u0026amp; detailed documentation. Onboarding offshore engineers unfamiliar with sports analytics ‚Üí Created a knowledge-sharing framework. 5Ô∏è‚É£ How This Prepares Me for Montai Therapeutics Handling Complex Scientific Data: Just as sports data is semi-structured and real-time, so is biomedical and cheminformatics data. Building Scalable Data Platforms: Expertise in Databricks, AWS, and Snowflake applies directly to Montai‚Äôs infrastructure needs. AI/ML Integration: Experience with LLMs and real-time analytics will help enhance scientific data processing. 6Ô∏è‚É£ Conclusion \u0026amp; Key Takeaways Built a scalable real-time sports data pipeline for Fox Sports. **Optimized data processing, reduced cos ","date":"February 16, 2025","hero":"/images/default-hero.jpg","permalink":"https://vishnutalanki.github.io/posts/fox_sports/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"fox-sports-deep-dive-senior-data-engineer-sports-data-platform\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFox Sports: Deep Dive (Senior Data Engineer, Sports Data Platform)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"abstract\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbstract\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Fox Sports Data Platform was built to process, enrich, and serve real-time sports data for major leagues like the \u003cstrong\u003eNFL, MLB, and NBA\u003c/strong\u003e.
